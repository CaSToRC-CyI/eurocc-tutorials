# EuroCC-2 project
	

EuroCC 2 will work to identify and address the skills gaps in the European High Performance Computing (HPC) ecosystem and coordinate cooperation across Europe to ensure a consistent skills base.

The role of EuroCC 2 is to establish and run a network of more than 30 NCCs across the EuroHPC Participating States. The NCCs act as single points of access in each country between stakeholders and national and EuroHPC systems. They operate on a regional and national level to liaise with local communities, in particular SMEs, map HPC competencies and facilitate access to European HPC resources for users from the private and public sector.

EuroCC 2 delivers training, interacts with industry, develops competence mapping and communication materials and activities, and supports the adoption of HPC services in other related fields, such as quantum computing, artificial intelligence (AI), high performance data analytics (HPDA) to expand the HPC user base.


# EuroCC Cyprus



The Computation-based Science and Technology Research Center (CaSToRC) of the Cyprus Institute (CyI) is designated by the government of Cyprus as the National Competence Center (NCC) in High Performance Computing (HPC) and related technologies of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science (DS).

This activity is part of the EuroCC projects.
